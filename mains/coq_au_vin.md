# Coq au vin de Edward de Pomiane

I bought a small chicken of three pounds [… ] The butcher is nice and has cut it
into pieces for me. I have in front of me the chicken and the following things:

- Butter: 80g.
- Smoked lard: 80g -- I tend to use pancetta or smoked bacon.
- Mushrooms: 125g.
- Onion: 150g.
- Thyme: 1 branch.
- Little Burgundy wine: one bottle.
- Cognac: one glass.
- Flour: one coffee spoon.

In a pan, I melt half the butter. I add the lard cut into small chunks. I let
them melt. [Yann: Since I use pancetta or smoked bacon, I cook it for a little
longer] I put the chicken pieces in. I leave them to cook for a small quater of
an hour, turning them from time to time. I add the onion, cut in quarters. I let
them change colour. I add salt and pepper. I add the mushrooms that I have
washed but not peeled and cut into slices. On top of everything, I pour the
bottle of wine. [Yann: Yes, the whole bottle. Just do what Pomiane tells you. He
is right.] I add the Thyme. I increase to high the heat under the uncovered pan.
The wine starts to boil in earnest. It reduces and at the same time dyes the
meat dark red. I am left with just a glass and a half of wine. I cover the pan,
and reduce the heat. I leave to cook for about twenty minutes. I test the meat
with a fork: it is perfectly cooked.

In a ball, I intimately mix the butter and the flour. I add two spoons of the
sauce. I put it in the pan. I mix it and add the cognac. I leave for another
five minutes. I taste it, if need be add salt and pepper. I bring it to the
table, and serve with the same wine that I used to cook.

[Yann: Yeah, in France you can get really good wine really cheap. This is
freaking expensive to use a £10 bottle of wine to cook with. So I tend to use
more expensive wine to drink and cheap wine to cook. It is wrong though.]

What to server with? I tend to use either steamed new potatoes or sweet potato
mash and a side of either green beans or sweet corn.

Desert is easy: get 5 types of fruits of different colours and a chocolate bar.
Do a fruit salad and sprinkle with broken pieces of chocolate.

Starter: Smoked salmon is always a good starter. Always.
