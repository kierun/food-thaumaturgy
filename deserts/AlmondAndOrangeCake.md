# Orange & Almond Cake

## Ingredients

- 2 oranges, about 280 g (10 oz) in total, scrubbed and roughly chopped (with
  skin)
- 5 eggs, separated
- 200 g (7 oz) caster sugar
- 225 g (8 oz) ground almonds
- 2 tbsp flaked almonds
- sifted icing sugar to decorate

## Instructions

- Put the chopped oranges in a small saucepan, discarding any pips. Add 1 tbsp
  water, then cover and cook gently for 30 minutes or until the oranges are soft
  and excess liquid has evaporated. Leave to cool.
- Preheat the oven to 180ºC (350ºF, gas mark 4). Line the bottom and sides of a
  23 cm (9 in) spring form cake tin with baking parchment. Finely chop the
  oranges in a food processor or blender, or with a large knife.
- Put the egg whites in a large bowl and whisk until they form stiff peaks.
  Gradually whisk in half the caster sugar, then whisk for 1 minute.
- Using the same whisk, whisk the egg yolks with the remaining caster sugar in
  another bowl for 2-3 minutes or until pale and quite thick. Whisk in the
  finely chopped oranges, then carefully fold in the ground almonds.
- Stir in 3 spoonfuls of the whisked egg white to loosen the mixture, then
  gently fold in the remaining whites with a large metal spoon. Transfer the
  mixture to the prepared tin and level the top. Sprinkle with the flaked
  almonds.
- Bake for 50-55 minutes or until the cake is golden and a skewer inserted in
  the centre comes out clean. Check the cake after 20 minutes and again at 30
  minutes, and cover lightly with foil if it is browning too quickly.
- Leave the cake to cool in the tin, then turn it out, peel away the lining
  paper and transfer to a serving plate. Dust with icing sugar before serving.
  The cake can be kept in an airtight tin for up to 2 days.
