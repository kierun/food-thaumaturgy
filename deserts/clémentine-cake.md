# *CLEM*ENTINE CAKE (or orange or lemon :-D)\*

Two versions, 1st is direct from Nigella and the 2nd is with Adrienne's and my
notes :-)

## Nigella's version

[Link](https://www.nigella.com/recipes/clementine-cake) INGREDIENTS Serves: 8-10

approx. 375 grams clementines (approx. 4) (or Oranges or Lemons) 6 large eggs
225 grams white sugar (250g is using lemons) 250 grams ground almonds 1 teaspoon
baking powder (see NOTE below)

(Can Glaze - Icing Sugar, Juice, Water)

METHOD

- Put the clementines in a pan with some cold water, bring to the boil,
  partially with the lid and cook for 2 hours. Drain, discarding the cooking
  water, and, when cool, cut each clementine in half and remove the pips. Dump
  the clementines - skins, pith, fruit and all - and give a quick blitz in a
  food processor (or by hand, of course). Preheat the oven to gas mark
  5/190ºC/170°C Fan/375ºF. Butter and line a 20cm / 8 inch Springform tin.
- You can then add all the other ingredients to the food processor and mix. Or,
  you can beat the eggs by hand adding the sugar, almonds and baking powder,
  mixing well, then finally adding the pulped oranges.
- Pour the cake mixture into the prepared tin and bake for an hour, when a
  skewer will come out clean; you'll probably have to cover with foil or
  greaseproof after about 40 minutes to stop the top burning. Remove from the
  oven and leave to cool, on a rack, but in the tin. When the cake's cold, you
  can take it out of the tin. I think this is better a day after it's made, but
  I don't complain about eating it at any time.
- I've also made this with an equal weight of oranges, and with lemons, in which
  case I increase the sugar to 250g / 2¼ cups and slightly anglicise it, too, by
  adding a glaze made of icing sugar mixed to a paste with lemon juice and a
  little water.

## Adrienne's version

Nigella's Recipe for Clementine Cake with additions from Adrienne!!

Ingredients 4-5 Clementines about 1ib (Adrienne uses 6) (I used the Easy Peeler
oranges, less pith so not as bitter and more tasty) 6 eggs 225 sugar 250g ground
almonds 1 heaped teaspoon baking powder

Method

- Put clementines in cold water. Boil for 2 hours . Drain, cool, cut in half and
  remove pips (Does not take 2 hours, 45-60 mins depending on the size of
  fruit).
- Pulp everything else in a food processor. (I used a Hand-Blender, very quick
  and easy, just a couple of mins, I also froze and it was fine so you could do
  a batch in advance)
- Preheat oven - gas mark 5/ 190 degree C /170 degree C fan.
- Butter and line 21cm springform tin. (Make sure it is one piece of paper, NOT
  a circle and sides. the mixture is really sloppy so you need to provide a
  single casing for it, just crease it into place)
- Beat eggs,add sugar, almonds and baking powder. Mix well. Add pulped oranges.
  Mix well again (It will be very sloppy but smells amazing!)
- Put mixture in tin.
- Cook for 35 minutes.
- Top will starts to catch. Cover with foil (Tent it so you don't touch the top,
  it will pull off the caramelization).
- Turn oven off and leave cake in for about an hour. Top will have caramelised.
  (This is the way Adrienne has decided makes the best cake!!!)
- It will sink in the middle, just the way it is.
- When cold remove from tin. (I lifted out the whole thing, paper and all, it
  will have pulled away from the side).

Nigella says she thinks it is better the day after it is made!

*FREEZING* Mum freezes it and it is fine

*Syrup* I tried to make caramelised zest and slices - that didn't really work
but I had to boil them in water and then I had some juice left, so I reduced it,
added sugar and a drop or two of Sainsbury's Valencian Orange Extract. Poured
some on the cake and some kept in a jar. If you did it better then me, you could
make a proper glaze so it went lovely and crusty :-D

*CUP Cakes* Nigella's team has tried cupcake but said they sank too much in the
middle, but you could give it a go and see if you like them.

I am happy to make this at any point :-D

Enjoy!
